# goal
Built to solve two problems: 1) to create randomly generated quiz questions, instead of fixed and predictable ones; and 2) for practice with the setTimeout() and setInterval() methods. Hence the app reinforces knowledge of all regular Greek nouns with time-based, programmatically generated parsing questions. Designed for desktop, but mobile compatible.
